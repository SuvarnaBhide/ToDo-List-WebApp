# Todolist

Todolist is a simple web-based to-do list application that allows you to manage your tasks. You can add new items, mark completed tasks, and delete items from the list.

## Installation

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the command `npm i` to install all the necessary node modules
3. Your web app should be running on http://localhost:3000/

## How to Use

1. View the default to-do list with some sample tasks.
2. To add a new item, type the task in the input field and press the "+" button.
3. To mark a task as completed, check the checkbox next to the task. The task text will be crossed out and deleted from your list.
5. You can also create custom to-do lists by appending the list name to the URL (e.g., http://localhost:3000/custom-list-name).
